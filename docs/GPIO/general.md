# GPIO

GPIO stands for General Purpose Input/Output, and it's a feature of the Raspberry Pi that allows it to interact with the
physical world. </br>
The Raspberry Pi has a set of 40 GPIO pins that can be used to send or receive digital signals to or
from external devices such as sensors, motors, LEDs, and more. 
</br>
These pins can be accessed through software programs
written in various programming languages, and can be configured as either inputs or outputs.</br> This allows the Raspberry
Pi to be used for a wide range of projects, from home automation to robotics and beyond.
